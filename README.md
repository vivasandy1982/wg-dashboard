## Description

#### What is this?

wg-dashboard is a user friendly and easy to use interface to manage your WireGuard instance and peers.

We made this dashboard to simplify the setup of WireGuard. Instead of having to use the terminal to manage settings we wanted an easy to use and nice looking GUI.
